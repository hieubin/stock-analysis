Internship grading:

Interns are lazy and do too sloppy!
(although he has been instructed on:
    - how to inspect the source website
    - how to search for API that returns data
    - how to convert to base request using python language
    - how to complete code in "Scrapy way" and extract data using ChatGPT)

The errors he encountered:
    1. use wrong API in code file
    2. put wrong file in spider project (should have recreated scrapy project)
    3. cannot extract necessary data

The commenter corrected at commitID d0d4a9e48cbc66d785f56cd2890a2e36cc09b857

Next development direction:

- put the list of assets on hsx that have been retrieved into the database (mongodb or postgre)
- based on the list just pushed into the database, get all the price history of the assets and push it into the database.
- use the price history to write a recommended system to choose the top 5 stocks by year. and predict the 5 best stocks to invest in the next year or the next 3, 5 years.
