Internship grading:

Interns are lazy and do too sloppy!
(although he has been instructed on:
    - how to inspect the source website
    - how to search for API that returns data
    - how to convert to base request using python language
    - how to complete code in "Scrapy way" and extract data using ChatGPT)

The errors he encountered:
    1. use wrong API in code file
    2. put wrong file in spider project (should have recreated scrapy project)
    3. cannot extract necessary data
